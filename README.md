# VirtuaMonster-Site
The VirtuaMonster website is a personal project to test out my web development skills. This will be my first time using bootstrap. The secondary goal of this personal project is to create a nicely designed website to showcase a mobile app that is currently in development called VirtuaMonster (the name may change). On the website I plan to create different web pages explaining the game mechanics, the different types of monsters, the different types of items, etc.
